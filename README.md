# Image processing pipeline

Modular image processing pipeline using OpenCV and Python generators.  


## Idea
Run Face-Recognition on image-list/video using latest techniqiue for it.
Modules:
 - Face Detection
 - Face Alignment
 - Face Features Extraction
 - Face Recognition
 - Gallery creation for Face-Recognition
 - Displaying the results
 - Saving results as JSON
 - Staring server 
 - Future: Data Clustering + Hand-Correction 

## Setup environment
